# Bugisoft-Disconnect-Stay-on-old-version-in-Win7
This is a tutorial to use Bugisoft Disconnect in older version without updating it and keep using it in is a desired build
Hello there,




================================================================================================================================================================================================================


First need Bugisoft Disconnect version 142.2.0.10887 (Stable / Unstable) Findable here :
https://uplay.en.uptodown.com/windows/download/103967318

After installed just launch bugisoft disconnect and when you see Bugisoft Disconnect updating close it imediatly and go into :

C:\Users\All Users\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher\patch
(Find version build and copy it -Its should be the folder itself just copy is number )

then go in Bugisoft Disconnect folder where are all the app and find version.txt and open it and change 10887 with the version number you finded in patch folder

better to create a shortcut of the patch folder and place this shortcut where you want, better to place it in Bugisoft Disconnect folder

For future update of B-D close IT !! and then double clic this Patch shortcut and see the version bugisoft trying to update take is number and paste it into version.txt folder (Erase the old one & paste the new one)

And that it you can use Older version without updating ^^

ps: I finded a Stable version of Bugisoft Disconnect and is version is 142.2.0.10899 (Stable) but strangly impossible to find Installer and i not saved the installer (-_-) i have only Portable Archive
